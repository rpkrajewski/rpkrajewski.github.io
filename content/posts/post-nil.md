Here I am again with a second attempt at a GitHub-hosted site
(blog). I am trying to keep it simple with Hugo and the
Ananke theme.

My first attempt was in Jekyll, and while I am sure it's a fine site
framework, I found that trying to preview sites on a Mac was a pain,
mostly because some of the crucial Ruby extensions that Jekyll needed
(at least at the time, this was a few years ago) had to be built on
demand with native code tools, similar to the CPAN Perl experience,
and these dependencies had conflicts with other parts of the
system. Even building on Linux was not an escape from this version of
DLL hell. Now, what problem was I trying to solve again?

Say what you want about Java, the language that's kept my family,
camera, and music collections happy for many years, but as long you
want to stay in the domains of general computation, web content, and
standards-based formats, it is very unlikely that will you need to go
outside the language ecosystem to rely on modules that need native
code interfaces. I also appreciate that Maven lets you rely on dynamic
build-time resolution isn't going to make your machine run a score of
builds from various packaging systems. It will only download half of
the Maven Central repository, at worst.

I also appreciate that since I last tried this, GitHub Pages deployment
doesn't have to bloat your repository with a published branch.

I will try to keep the blog meta-commentary to a minimum, I
promise.
